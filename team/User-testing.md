# User Testing

User testing is when we schedule time with one person, and observe them using an application or prototype.

## When to do user testing?
* As part of design thinking, develop protypes and test them with as soon as possible
* After significant revisions to a design, you can schedule additional testing
* Before starting development on a design or mockup
* After enough of an application is built for a tester to do things and provide useful feedback
* To test out different possible options for a design

## Schedule
* A github ticket can be used to track user testing as part of a sprint
* Include the tech team on the invite; they do not all have to come
* Ideally at least 2 team members should attend: one to "guide" the testing, and a "recorder" for note taking
* When possible, prepare to record the meeting
  * Also let the tester know we will record the testing session, make sure they are aware and ok with it
* Use a meeting invite to schedule the tester, and reserve a conf room for team members
  * Include context and expectation setting for the tester (todo: template email)
* How long to schedule depends on how much will be tested, usually 0.5 - 1 hour
* Send out a link and instructions on how the tester and team can get into the session
  * Even if the tester is in person, use zoom/slack/hangouts so remote team members can join and observe
  * Include info about screen sharing for the participant
* Also schedule a debrief meeting after the testing session to discuss findings with team members
  * Ideally, immediately following testing, or ASAP

## Preparation
* Make sure any login credentials are ready, and tested to make sure the tester can get into the application
* Check any data is setup and makes sense, ideally use data the tester will find meaningful
* Have team member roles assigned
* Make sure the A/V setup is working
* Prepare questions, scenarios to be tested, things to try, especially where tester feedback can help decide on the design

## Kicking off testing
* Make sure the session is being recorded
* After the tester joins, and pleasantries are exchanged, introduce them to the testing process
* Emphasize this is a work in progress, and all feedback is appreciated
* Explain what we are hoping to test, and what you would like them to try to do
* Provide a context for them, such as a specific activity or goal, and ask them about additional such actions and goals
* Ask them to "think out loud" so we can know better what is happening

## During the testing, the guide should:
* Provide as little guidance as possible, to try to get the tester's unadulterated reactions and thoughts
* Try to ask questions, and use questions as answers back to the tester
* If the tester is struggling, don't explain, ask what they think should happen, and encourage trying things
* If other issues or topics come up, have the recorder note this issue, and try to move on with testing
* If a tester has not tried a part of the app yet, ask them to do some action that would require them to use it
* When a tester gets stuck, ask them to try a different scenario, or ask how else they might use the app/prototype

## During the testing, the recorder should:
* The recorder should take down the users exact words and actions with little interpretation
* Include guide questions and tester answers
* Take notes chronologically, note when the user moves to a different page or scenario
* Note places in the flow or app where the user hesitates, misinterprets, or struggles
* Note what they like, or where they do something easily
* Note anything the user suggests or wishes could be different or added

## After the testing
* Thank the tester for their time, and ask them for any final thoughts or suggestions, such as "what did we not ask about?"
* Ask the tester what they thought of the testing process, and any suggestions for that
* Thank them again (why not) and ask if we can reach out to them again for testing a later iteration of the app

## Debrief
* After the testing, get together with the team to discuss
* Go over the notes, and discuss what the tester liked, and where they struggled
* Identify areas to change, and open tickets for making changes to explore these in the next version
* Where possible discuss, and as time allows, discuss specific changes to try in the next version
* Open tickets for issues brought up byu the tester
* Open tickets for new enhancements suggested by the user or that came up in discussion
