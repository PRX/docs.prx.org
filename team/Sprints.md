Sprints
=======

# Overview

Although [tickets are managed](Issue-Management.md) using a [Kanban](http://kanbanblog.com/explained/) process, we organize our time into cycles using the [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum) framework. Each cycle is a specific period of time (a Sprint) during which we focus on a particular set of groomed issues. We bookend the Sprint with ceremonies in order to provide a regular rhythm of planning and reflection.

# Planning

The Sprint begins with planning which issues will be addressed and by whom. To be included in a Sprint, an issue must have a **Priority** and an **Estimate**.

Prior to the Planning meeting, team members identify those issues from the `Backlog` which they believe can and should be completed during the Sprint, and assigns each issue to themselves as the **Assignee** and to the **Milestone** specific to the Sprint.

During the Planning meeting, all the issues in the Sprint **Milestone** are briefly reviewed, verifying with the **Assignee** that the **Estimate** and **Priority** are correct.

The goal of the Planning meeting is to align the team's expectations about the Sprint to come. We know we were accurate in our planning if during the Review meeting there are zero issues that are incomplete.

# Review

The Sprint ends with a review of the **Milestone** issues and any relevant demonstrations of work accomplished. If an issue is not in the `Done` or `Closed` **Pipeline** we try and determine why, and whether it should be moved to the next **Milestone** or put back into the general `Backlog`. We [avoid blame](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) and [apologies](http://retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html), and instead focus on surfacing those events that helped or hurt our ability to accomplish what we thought we could. This meeting is fairly short (less than 30 minutes).

# Retrospective

The Review meeting focuses on the "what" of the Sprint. The Retrospective meeting focuses on the "how" of the Sprint. We ask ourselves what went well, what did not, and what actions we should take to adjust our practices for next time. This meeting can take up to an hour.
