# Software Developer Hiring Process

## Inspiration

- The [18F Hiring Guide](https://eng-hiring.18f.gov/)
- The Rework Podcast [Hiring is not Hazing](https://rework.fm/hiring-is-not-hazing/)
- ...

## Purpose

To standardize and organize our hiring process for tech team devs, so we can
be more inclusive and transparent to candidates.

Some of these steps must be accomplished by specific PRX persons, but the idea
is we can have swap different folks out and still achieve a equitable result
for the candidates.

## Steps

1. Resume review
    - Async by any/all **Tech Team**
    - Quick thumbs up/down in Workable for each app
    - Base on candidates experience, background, and enthusiasm
    - Avoid long discussions, and opt to move them on if there's a conflict
    - Any candidate with 3 thumbs up moves on
2. Phone screen candidate
    - ~25 minutes with one **Tech Team** member
    - Schedule a call
    - High level description of PRX, team and role
    - Talk about their background and experience
    - Connect with rest of **Tech Team** async, and decide whether to interview
    - Notify candidate **RIGHT NOW** if we're not interviewing
3. Technical venture
    - Work with candidate async to determine suitable technical pre-work to best
      highlight the candidate's experience and abilities.
    - Could be:
      - Async code challenge
      - An OSS pull request
      - Something they've already built
      - https://eng-hiring.18f.gov/pre-work/
      - ...
    - Candidate should spend no more than 2 hours preparing this work. If it's
      still incomplete - that's still a very interesting conversation!
    - Candidate should be prepared to run/edit their project at interview
4. Technical interview
    - ~55 minutes with 2+ **Tech Team** members
    - Candidate walks through their venture
    - Tech team asks questions. Have a discussion.
      - How-might-we questions are always good
      - Optionally pair program a bit to make changes
      - Ask "what next"... how to iterate features
      - ...
    - Set a timeline for when they'll hear back
5. Untechnical interview
    - ~25 minutes with 2+ **PRX Hiring Team** members
    - Tell candidate more about the broader PRX ecosystem
    - Talk about their background and experience
    - Make time for Q&A!
6. Debrief
    - Get PRX employees that met candidate together
    - After every pair of interviews, in order candidates were interviewed
    - Share information and discuss interviews
      - https://eng-hiring.18f.gov/debrief/
    - Bring notes! Watch out for unconscious bias!
    - Take notes!
7. Selection and Offer
    - CTO and Hiring manager
    - Decide specific salary and benefits to offer
      - Which were hopefully outlined in the job description
      - Which are in line other PRX compensations and job descriptions
    - Extend an offer
      - Email
    - Notify other interviewed candidates
