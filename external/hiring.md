# Software Developer Hiring Process

## Purpose

To standardize and organize our hiring process for tech team devs, so we can
be more inclusive and transparent to candidates.

## Steps

1. Resume review
    - You can expect several team members to review your resume
    - Don't stress too much about this, we know getting to know you takes more than a resume.
2. Phone screen candidate
    - ~25 minutes with one **Tech Team** member
    - We'll give you a high level description of PRX, team and role
    - You'll get a chance to tell us about your background and experience
3. Technical venture
    - Pick a feature to implement that highlights your skills and experience. Could be:
      - One of our [code-ventures](https://github.com/PRX/code-ventures) challenges
      - An OSS or personal project feature/bug
      - Something you've already built
    - Let us know what you've decided to work on, and we'll make sure that makes sense for this process
      - If you picked our `code-ventures`, we'll create a private repo for you
      - Otherwise, just make sure we have access to see your code
    - Spend **no more than 2 hours** implementing some or all of the feature
    - Open a pull request containing your changes
    - Send us a link to your pull request, and a few 1-hour blocks of time you're available in the next ~week for step (4)
4. Technical interview
    - ~55 minutes with 2+ **Tech Team** members
    - You should be prepared to run, walk us through, and discuss your venture
      - Your pull request is kind of a springboard for talking software-development in general
    - We'll also ask you questions!
      - These questions will be routed in our human and empathy centered process
      - We'll weigh tradeoffs, and talk through how we might alter the code to handle edge cases
      - May involve a bit of pairing, with a PRXer doing the typing
      - There will NOT be gotchas or other inteview negging
      - We want to know who you are at your best, not your worst
    - And you'll get to tell us all about your technical skills in this interview
5. Untechnical interview
    - ~25 minutes with 2+ **PRX Hiring Team** members
    - We collaborate with our clients and the rest of the company frequently.  So we want to hear what they think of you!
    - A great opportunity to talk more generally about your skills.
    - There will be time for you to ask questions and learn about the company from a non technical perspective.
7. Selection and Offer
    - Then comes the big decision for us, followed by hopefully the big decision for you!
