These are the standards and best practices to be followed so long as they make sense and changed when we figure out a better way.

## Basics

### Repository

- Projects should be stored to the PRX Github organization.
- They should have LICENSE and README.md files at the root.

### Naming

- For an application or service, name the repository with the production domain name
  - e.g. the CMS service runs as 'cms.prx.org', and that is PRX/cms.prx.org on github

- For a gem, use standard gem naming practices with underscores and dashes.
- Add 'prx' to the name only if it is specific to PRX, not just as the source.

### Documentation

Reference these standards in the README so as not to repeat their full explanation.

The following is also required for a web project README.md:
- Badges for travis, coveralls, code climate, and gemnasium
- Description
- Installation
- Integrations and/or dependencies
- Usage
- License
- Contributing, includes reassignment of copyright
